### Hi, my name is Michael ðŸ‘‹

I've been passionate about software development for more than 25 years.

For the last 13 years, I've been working on the [open source Neo4j graph database](https://neo4j.com/developer/get-started) filling many roles, most recently leading the Developer Relations team, working on DX initiatives and organizing the [Neo4j Labs](https://neo4j.com/labs) efforts.

As caretaker of the Neo4j community and ecosystem I love to work with graph-related projects, users, and contributors.

In general I enjoy many aspects of programming languages, learning new things every day, participating in exciting and ambitious open source projects and contributing and writing software related books and articles. 
I spoke at numerous conferences and helped organized several of them. 

My efforts in the Java community got me accepted to the [JavaChampions](https://dev.java/community/jcs/) program.

I'm running a weekly [girls-only coding club](https://www.technogirls.net/) at our local school.
